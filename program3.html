            Atoms of radioactive elements can split. According to Albert Einstein, mass and energy are interchangeable under certain circumstances. <br>
        </p>
        <p style="color:brown;font-family:monospace">
            When atoms split, the process is called nuclear fission. In this case, a small amount of mass is converted into energy.
        </p>

            Thus the energy released cannot do much damage. However, several subatomic particles called neutrons are also emitted during this process. 
        </p>
        <p style="color:yellow;font-size:xx-large;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
            Each neutron will hit a radioactive element releasing more neutrons in the process.
        </p>
        <p style="color: springgreen;font-size: large;font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">
            This causes a chain reaction and creates a large amount of energy. This energy is converted into heat which expands uncontrollably causing an explosion.
        </p>

            Hence, atoms do not literally explode. They generate energy that can cause explosions.
