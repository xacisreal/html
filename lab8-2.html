    <h1>Tree Data Structure</h1>
    <p>Root: The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In other words, the root node is
        the one that doesn't have any parent. In the above structure, node numbered 1 is the root node of the tree. If a
        node
        is directly linked to some other node, it would be called a parent-child relationship.
        Child node: If the node is a descendant of any node, then the node is known as a child node.
        Parent: If the node contains any sub-node, then that node is said to be the parent of that sub-node.
        Sibling: The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings.</p>
